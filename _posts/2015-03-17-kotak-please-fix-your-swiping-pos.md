title: Kotak, why you hold my money for 30 days ?
date: 2015-03-17 07:00:00
summary: I had swipped my Kotak debit card & the payment goes (I get a SMS) but the mechant crib that they did not get the money making them swipe my card again. It has happened twice with me, so I am assuming it is something to do with kotak backend & not the POS machine manufacturer.

It was a nice Tuesday morning. I have a flight at 8:05AM in the morning & I have reached at 6:00AM, comfortably ahead of time. When I tried getting in at the gate, the guard pointed that I have the air ticket for April 14 (that day was March 17). So I rushed to the Indigo counter for rescheduling the flight. I was not exactly running out of time, but surely, I cant afford the luxury of lot of time in hand. 

I was pleasantly surprised when the person at counter told me a figure of Rs 1371 as the extra amount that I would need to pay for rescheduling. It looked small amount but I was happier because the plane had some empty seats. 

But then, the inevitable happened. I had given my Kotak card, it was swipped, I got a confirmation SMS & I was told, the money has not come. This time, I handed over my Axis bank card & the payment went through.

This is not exactly the first time this happened with me. It has happened once before at Brewsky, Sarjapura Road, Bangalore. That time, I actually had luxury of lot of time, so I took it in writing from the Brewsky authorities that they actually have swipped it twice.

**When I followed up with Kotak bank & sent them a scanned copy of the letter, I was being told that one of the transaction has not been claimed by the merchant & they have 30 days. If they dont claim it during that time, the money will be refunded.**

*So I have to wait for 30 days & if the money does not come back, I need to then go check with the merchant if they have claimed the transaction (mistakingly) or if Kotak guys system malfunctioned & the money never came back. I hope you see the point.* 

Now this time, instead of writing an email or calling Kotak bank, I thought of writing this open letter. If you are a concerned person at Kotak, please put up a reply to this blog post as to what is your stance on the problem. I have realized that 'open communication' generate better & more effective response than closed (email/call) communication. 

Thank You
