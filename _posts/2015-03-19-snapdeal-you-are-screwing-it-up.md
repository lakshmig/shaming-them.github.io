summary: I wanted to buy a camera which was put on discount on Snapdeal. I never knew I had to buy it thrice & Snapdeal will be shipping 2 cameras (as for today).

I had placed an order with Snapdeal for a Canon 1200D camera. There was an offer at Snapdeal where the camera was available at a discounted price of 25000. However, when I was placing an order and the payment was getting processed, the price got revised and instead of Rs. 25000, Rs. 27000 was deducted from my account without any prior intimation. After this, I cancelled the order subsequent to which it was informed that the amount can be credited only after 7 days.

Next day, i.e today, again I placed a fresh order with Snapdeal for the same camera where it was available for Rs. 26700 (order number is-  5348527152). After I placed the order, I received 5 mails from Snapdeal confirming my order. I even received an SMS to this effect. However, when I called the customer care, they said that there was a technical glitch because of which Snapdeal has not confirmed your order and hence the order will be cancelled and the products will never be delivered to you. On asking as to what about the confirmation mails that I had been receiving from Snapdeal, they asked me to ignore those mails. They advised me to place a fresh order when the price has been revised to Rs. 28000. When I told them that already Rs. 55000 has been stuck with Snapdeal, why should I place a new order, they replied that this is what they can do and they cannot process the refund also before 7 days. Considering this experience in relation to these two orders, I would request the senior officials of Snapdeal to look into your resolution mechanism closely and stop claiming that you guarantee resolution of every compliant because this is not true at all.
