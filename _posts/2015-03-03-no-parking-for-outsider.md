My wife Lakshmi & her friend Shilpa (who is a lawyer by profession) had gone to an Aerobics class in BTM 2nd stage. They had parked their 2 wheeler, TVS weego closeby & did not notice this 'no parking outside vehicle' sign on the wall put by the owner of the house **Akshara, #738,7th cross 12 th main, Btm 2nd stage, Bangalore** . The sign read *no parking outside vehicle*

When they came out of the class at around 8 PM, they found their vehicle has been displaced *ungraciously* by the house owner car. The worse part is, the owner has not even put it on the stand. Rather, it was parked with the tree support like how you park your cycle when it has no stand

On confronting the owner as to why he has done that, his reply was - do whatever you want, call whomsoever you want. My friend Shilpa is a tough nut. She contacted police on 100. Police has said they will come. As for now, they are still waiting for police to turn up (it has been an hour). I have sent tweets to Bangalore City Police & Bangalore Commissioner. Lets see what happens next. Sit tight (& tweet this link if you like others to know). Will be posting updates as soon as I hear from them.
