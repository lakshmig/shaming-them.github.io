My wife Lakshmi & her friend Shilpa (who is a lawyer by profession) had gone to an Aerobics class in BTM 2nd stage. They had parked their 2 wheeler, TVS weego closeby & did not notice this 'no parking for outsiders' sign on the wall put by the owner of the house **Akshara, #738,7th cross 12 th main, Btm 2nd stage, Bangalore**

When they came out of the class at around 8 PM, they found their vehicle has been displaced *ungraciously* by the house owner car. The worse part is, the owner has not even put it on the stand. Rather, it was parked with the tree support like how you park your cycle when it has no stand

On confronting the owner as to why he has done that, his reply was - do whatever you want, call whomsoever you want. My friend Shilpa is a tough nut. She contacted police on 100. Police has said they will come. As for now, they are still waiting for police to turn up (it has been an hour). 

I have sent tweets to Bangalore City Police & Bangalore Commissioner. Lets see what happens next. Sit tight (& tweet this link if you like others to know). Will be posting updates as soon as I hear from them.

###Update at 9:56 PM

Wife just called & said police has come to the spot. On inquiring with the house resident, it was being told that there is some handicap tenant (or some family member) who is unable to move the vehicles parked. They also put up a sorry face & start narrating story about how a lot of people park their vehicles & how it is a nuisance for them. 

On poiting that they have 3 cars in their house & hence they need space on the street, they turned an ignorant face & probably have nothing to speak about. Police took note & left house with a stern warning. Not sure if they will remove the 'no parking outside vehicles' board from the tree though. 

###Update on March 4, 4:00 PM

[@blrcitytraffic](http://twitter.com/blrcitytraffic) has put BTM Mico Layout traffic inspector incharge of the case & passed on his number.

I have forwarded the same to my friend Shilpa. She has told me that she is going to follow up with the inspector & see if they enforce removing of the sign board. More to come, stay tuned ...
