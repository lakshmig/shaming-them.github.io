    Dear [RBI](http://rbi.org.in) Governor,
    
    This is going to be a little long letter, so please bear with me for sometime. 
    
    I am [Ashish](http://twitter.com/pocha), an IIT Madras grad & (still) Director of company, Codelearn Learning Pvt. Ltd. We incorporated way back in Dec 2012, when Jeremie from [Kima Ventures](www.kimaventures.com) confirmed an amount of USD 150k funding over **series of emails**. Please note, all that it takes for someone who has never met us, to trust & send that kind of money to us.
