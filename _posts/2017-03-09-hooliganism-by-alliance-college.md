Dear @CPBlr (Police Commissioner Bangalore), 

I am Shilpa, a lawyer by profession & currently staying at **#11, ground floor, 7th Main, 20 cross, BTM 2nd Stage** for past 2 years. I own a black Santro, Number KA 19, Z2343 which I park in the **public area next to Alliance College premise** as the street I stay in is very narrow & there is no parking space close to my house. 

I have been doing this for past 2 years at least. I had parked the car on Monday, March 6th at the same location. When I went there on March 7th, Tuesday morning, I found the car missing. 

I went to Mico Layout traffic police station & found my car there. I was told that a complaint was raised by Alliance College authorities that the car is wrongfully parked & hence the car was towed away. 

On asking as to, did they confirm if the car was wrongly parked, we were not being given any answer. We were told that the police is suppose to act on a compliant & that is what they did. 

I spoke to Mr K R Ravikumar at Mico Layout Traffic Police Station on Tuesday. 

I was told that if I have car keys, I can pick the car & take it back, which I did. I parked the car back at the same location. 

Today morning, when I went to pick it, I found it surrounded by people who are threatening to take away the car else if something happens to it, they would not be responsible.

I am currently on my way to report this issue to the police station Mico layout. I wanted to send a heads up about it with the full story here.

Thanks
