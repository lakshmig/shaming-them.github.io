Dear @CPBlr (Police Commissioner Bangalore), 

I am Basavraj, brother of Ashwini - 22 years female - who got admitted to St. Johns hospital in the night of May 20 for third degree burns she suffered in her hometown Hosalli at around 10:30 AM. 

We rushed her to the Jindal hospital & the doctors over there told us to take her to St. Johns hospital & that is what we did. 

She expired at 10 PM on May 22 (Monday). We were told by the St. Johns authority that a memo was sent to the Kormangla police & police from Sandur need to come here to approve the memo & take the body. We informed Sandur police office (Head Constable Abdul - Ph ) in the night itself. They arrived at around 9:30 AM today morning & reported at Kormangla police station at around 10:30 AM today. 

Currently they are in Kormangla police station. The police officer there is now telling that the local Tehsildar need to visit the hospital & then decide on if the Post Mortem need to be done. We tried reaching Tehsildar on his phone number but he is not picking up the call.  

This is unnecesarily delaying things for us. We intended to take the body to hometown & get the post mortem as well as cremation done today itself. 

We will not have freezer box in the village & we will be unable to keep the body overnight over there, which will be the case if this matter delays. 

Hence I am requesting you to please intervene & tell the authorities to not delay the process by introducing various kinds of unncessary procedure around it.

Thanks<br/>
BasavRaju<br/>
