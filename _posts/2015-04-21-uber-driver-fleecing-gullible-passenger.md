Dear Uber Bangalore, 

 I & a few of my friends are big fan of your service. I really want the taxi business to stay & I think it is important to identify & publicly shame the rogue drivers for two reasons 

1. Such practice comes into light & the drivers take a lesson so that they dont think that they can do such acts & get away easily
2. It will weed out rogue drivers from the system which is necessary for ongoing belief in the system for general public & good drivers

 I had booked Uber Go at 8:25 PM in BTM Layout 2nd Stage, Bangalore. It was booked for a friend who is new in town. The taxi arrived at 8:30 PM, pretty much on time. The driver was Ravi, phone no - 9916560795. My friend had to go to Brookfield in Whitefield. There is a direct route, but the driver went somewhere around Sarjapur road, pretty deep, backtracked the ride & came back to ORR.

Ideally, the total distance is around 18km & as per Google, it should take around 35 min. As per the bill, it was 35 km ride. 

FYI. 

Thank You
